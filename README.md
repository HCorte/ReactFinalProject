# Frontend React - Challenge

Using Vite.

1. For Runnning in Development mode use:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
2. The port defined in the .env file is 8080 as well the hostname: http://localhost.
   Those values can be changed but those changes need to be replicated in the Backend .env file as well. So when doing the Requests to the backend don't fail.

- VITE_API_HOSTNAME=http://localhost
- VITE_API_PORT=8080
